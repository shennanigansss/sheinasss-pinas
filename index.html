                    <p>
                        A dog was stabbed to death by a vendor in Subic, Zambales after it reportedly stealing meat from her stall.
                        According to a report in “State of the Nation” on Wednesday, the video recorded by a witness showed that the bloodied dog named “Tiger” was still walking even when its organs were already visible.

                        The video owner said they decided to record the aspin’s (asong Pinoy) situation after it walked in their direction.
                        
                        The meat vendor was already arrested, the report said.</p>

                    <h4>DepEd: P65M recovered from 54 schools after voucher probe</h4>
                    <p>MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Education (DepEd) has successfully recovered P65 million from private schools linked to alleged anomalies in the Senior High School (SHS) Voucher Program claims, Education Secretary Sonny Angara said on Wednesday.

                        Angara said demand letters were sent to 54 schools terminated from the program to return the voucher claims for school years (SY) 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.
                        He said 38 schools have “fully refunded the government,” while two only made partial refunds, amounting to P65 million. Fourteen schools have yet to return the funds. He did not say how much was recovered from each school.
